#  News API

A Spring Boot application that loads news data from JSON, stores it in the database, simulates user events, and provides intelligent news search and trending functionality using OpenAI and Redis caching.

##  Setup Instructions


---

##  Application Behavior on Startup

- On application start:
  - Required database tables are created automatically (via JPA/Hibernate).
  - JSON data from `news_data.json` is loaded and stored in the database.
  - Simulated user events are inserted into the relevant table for testing/trending.

##  User Query Endpoint

- **URL**:
  ```
  http://localhost:8081/api/v1/news/dynamic?query=user query
  ```

- **Method**: `GET`

- **Description**:
  Automatically detects **intents** and **categories** from the user query using **OpenAI**, and internally routes the query to the appropriate search or filter logic.

- **Example**:
  ```http
  GET http://localhost:8081/api/v1/news/dynamic?query=latest finance news from news18
  ```
```http
  GET http://localhost:8081/api/v1/news/dynamic?query=news near me&lat=21.334455

##  Caching Behavior

- Before querying the database, the application checks **Redis cache** for faster response.
- If the response is not found in Redis, it fetches from the **database**, then stores it in Redis for future use.
